This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with implicit parameters in Groovy closures. The `bug.groovy` file shows the unexpected behavior of a closure without explicitly passing a parameter, while `bugSolution.groovy` offers a corrected version.  The problem arises from how Groovy handles implicit parameters ('it') within nested or specifically defined closure scopes.
